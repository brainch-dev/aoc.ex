# Aoc

Advent of Code in hopefully idiomatic (even if not fast) Elixir.

Run `mix get [year] [day]` to get the input for a day saved in `input/[year]/[day].txt`.

Add tests with the provided macro `test! "[year] - Day [day]: [title] (part [part])"`
to just run the code and see the output. Add the expected value as second argument
to just check during refactoring.
